    Let's talk more about restoring a commit.

    When you make many commits, they will be tracked in the main branch or master branch.
    But when you return back to any previous commit and decide to restore that commit, a new branch is formed.

    This commit will be outside the master branch and any other commits after that will continue in that other branch.

    Since this branch is auto generated and not created by yourself, is you return and restore a commit from master branch, the other branch will disappear from log graph. [log --all --graph]


    To prevent that, we will learn to create branch in git.
