    >> Fetch remote repo <<

    Manoj has already updated remote repo in GitHub but my terminal still doesn't know that .
    SO, we'll fetch that updated version of remote repo.

    Remember, this is useful when multiple users are working on a same project in different pc.

    Command:
            git fetch

    Now, in Adip's pc, origin/master will be ahead of HEAD -> master.
    Becoz he still hasn't pull those changes to his local repo.
