    I am creating a folder 'git-learning' in my Desktop.
    Your folder name can be anything you want.

    To use git your commands on terminal needs to working in your that folder.

    Ways to do that:
    1)  Open command prompt or powershell or any terminal you have.
        Write 
                cd <folder address>
        Eg: cd Desktop\git-learning
            This will open the terminal in folder/directory 'git-learning' which is located in my Desktop

    2)  Open the folder you want use git in.
        Right-click to get a drop down menu.
        Click 'Run in Terminal'
        This'll directly open terminal in your folder.
