    Now we'll learn to use GitHub.

    Repository = a folder containing code where any changes to the code are tracked by git. 
    (To create a repository, we create a new folder on our computer, and then run  git init 

    local repository - repository in your computer
    remote repository - repository in internet i.e. GitHub

    >> GitHub<<

    ~ Download GitHub or go to  www.github.com
    ~ Create an id
    ~ Create a new repository       [ repository - folder ]
            Ex: https://github.com/adiprijal/git-learning
