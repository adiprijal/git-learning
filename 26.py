    >> Setting up a SSH key <<

        Remember in 16.py, we linked our local repo with to remote repo using our GitHub repository url.

        There we used our https url to link.

        But if you face any problem with that 
        OR,
        You don't want to use your github password..

            We link our repo using SSH key..

        Think of SSH key as a file that contains a passkey to our remote repository.
        And when ever we git push, system passes this SSH key to verify that we are the owner.


        Turns out setting SSH key is little hectic to write out all steps ..

        SO I am skipping that... don't mind.

        well it is not that important..
        but if you have error using https url, then use youtube to learn to set up SSH key.
