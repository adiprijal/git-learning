    >> Pull from GitHub to local repo <<

    'git push' pushes our local repo to remote repo.

    git pull <remote_name> <branch>

    Ex:
        git pull origin master
            This command pulls our master branch from remote repo to local repo.


    We can also use upstream to shorten this command...

        git pull origin master --set-upstream

        --set-upstream works for both push and pull if you do it for either one of them.
