    >> commit using VSC <<

    Some code editor provides git integration feature like VSCode

    this feature makes it easier to use git without having to use 'Terminal' to write git commands

    I use VSCode.
    It has git integration.

    On the left side of vscode , there is a button named ' Source Control '

    This button is git using area.


    In 'Changes' section , all changes after last add are shown.
    These are the changes that has still not been added or commited.

    click '+' sign of the respective file you want to add to new commit
    This is similar to using 
                git add <file>

    Click '-' to bring the file back to 'Changes' from 'Staged Changes'
    Similar to using
                git reset <file>

    After adding, changed file moves to 'Staged Changes' section

    Staging Area  = contains changes that will go into the next commit 

    write message in message box and click 'Commit'
    >NEW COMMIT IS CREATED<

    Similar to using
                git commit --m "message"

    You can also amend by clicking 'Commit(Amend)' button
                git commit --m "message" --amend


                
    You can also compare changes, commits or discard changes.
    You can also see the lists of your commits.
