    create a file named as ".gitignore"
    inside your git containing directory 

    It tells git which files/folders to not track

    just write the name of the file or folders inside .gitignore to not track changes in those files

    Ex: 
    # .gitignore                    { inside .gitignore }
        git-sheet.pdf

        this code stop the tracking of git-sheet.pdf
