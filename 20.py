    Now, lets learn to set a shortcut to do git push.
    Until now, to git push we have to run
        git push origin master

    Now to reduce this command to only two words we do...

    git push <remote_name> <branch> --set--upstream

    Ex:     git push origin master --set--upstream
        
    Now, we have set ' origin master ' as default push setting for this repo.

    Now, we can use command;
            git push

        This works exactly like git push origin master

    Remember, both the commands works.
